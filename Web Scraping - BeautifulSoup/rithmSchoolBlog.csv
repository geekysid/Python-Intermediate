1,React Hooks! - useEffect,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/react-hooks-use-effect,"
Welcome back to the Rithm School series on React hooks.  In this blog post, I'll introduce useEffect, a very useful and potentially confusing new hook in React.  useEffect can be used in place of three lifecycle methods: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.  The details of how useEffect replaces all three methods is what we will be exploring in this blog post.
A working knowledge of some basics of hooks (especially some understanding of useState) is important for this post.  If you haven't read my earlier post introducing hooks, or if you want a refresher, check it out here.

2,It’s 2020: Where are the Women in Tech?,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/it-is-2020-where-are-the-women-in-tech,"
2019 is coming to a close and our staff conversations at Rithm are taking on a more reflective quality: how did we do this year, both as an organization and as individuals? Where did we excel and, more importantly, where could we improve? From curriculum and culture, to the impact of our space and the overall student experience, everything is fair game.
These end-of-year conversations include a recurrent topic that tends to swing (seemingly) unpredictably from cohort to cohort throughout the year: the number of women enrolled as students.
Now, the dearth of women employed in technical roles is not a revelation; about 25% of software engineers worldwide identify as women. And at the risk of sounding trite, this is not a simple problem to solve. From the way that girls are socialized to feel about math and science, to a general lack of awareness and understanding of what computer science is, to more nuanced cultural and social factors that result in women leaving tech all together later on, countless articles have been written from every angle imaginable.
Everywhere we turn, we’re confronted with disheartening figures and statistics, but for the purposes of this post, we’ll forgo the rehashing of the current landscape. The landscape is what it is in this moment. What we’re most interested in is what we can do within the coding bootcamp sector to move the needle.

3,Implementation Intentions: The Secret Weapon to Achieve Your Goals,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/implementation-intentions,"
It’s that time of the year again, where everyone is making ambitious goals they will most likely never follow through with. You have probably read about how to set SMART goals and how writing your goals down makes you more likely to achieve them. I recommend both of those strategies, but don’t stop there. Do you set yearly goals? Do you achieve them?

5,Student Interview: Jennifer + Luke on Company Projects,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/student-interview-jennifer-luke,"
At Rithm, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare students for jobs as web developers is by giving them opportunities to work on real-world projects. Working on personal projects can be fun, but working in a team or on an existing code base gives students insights into the day-to-day challenges of a developer that they might not otherwise learn. Our 13th cohort is wrapping up their company projects with JumpOffCampus, a new platform forging partnerships between Universities and safe, secure, off-campus housing. Jennifer Ma and Luke Nemy have been working on the same team using React, Ruby on Rails, and Google Maps API to incorporate a live map and rental listings with filters based on a user’s selected location. We asked them to share their experience working together with us:

6,React Hooks! - An Introduction,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/react-hooks-intro,"
Hooks are here! At Rithm School we are constantly reviewing our curriculum and making sure that we are up to date on the latest technologies.  When we notice a new technology or technique rising in popularity (and also becoming a common question that interviewers ask), we have the ability to quickly incorporate it into what we are teaching.
Since the introduction of hooks into React, we have clearly seen a strong interest in the community to use hooks in new React projects.  My goal is to give you a brief introduction to hooks and show you how they can be used instead of using class components with setState.

Or maybe you've just been working with REST for so long that you think there's a better way. Regardless of where you're coming from, we'll be introducing what GraphQL is, how it acts as an alternative to REST, and how to get started with queries.

8,Alumni Spotlight: Sandy Cao,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/alumni-spotlight-sandy,"
With a background in fine art, proudly toting her senior superlative of “Most Artistic”, Sandy Cao didn’t consider herself the typical candidate for a coding bootcamp. She hadn’t worked a full-time job in nearly 3 years (as a business analyst at a fintech startup in New Jersey) before joining us as a student at Rithm School. However, during her time with that job, she taught herself SQL and the thrill of completing code stuck with her. Sandy took some time to discuss her job search, her experience at Rithm, and her wisdom for other women looking to break into the tech scene.

9,Student Interview: Pair Programming And Company Projects,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/student-interview-pair-programming-and-company-projects,"
At Rithm, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare students for jobs as web developers is by giving them opportunities to work on real-world projects. Working on personal projects can be fun, but working in a team or on an existing code base gives students insights into the day-to-day challenges of a developer that they might not otherwise learn. Our 12th cohort is wrapping up their company projects with Numero, a modern financial platform that Members of Congress, Senate, and Presidential candidates rely on to manage the $4.5 billion in payment processing, accounting, and compliance for their political campaigns. Gabe and Joanna have been working as a pair, as well have Andrew and Chantal. We asked them to share their experience working together with us:

10,Getting Acquainted With A Production Code Base,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/getting-up-to-speed-on-a-production-code-base,"
At Rithm School, company projects have started.  If you’re not familiar with company projects, it’s a three week portion of our curriculum where students work with instructors and outside companies on a real production code base. It can be a challenging time for both students and instructors as we’re all working together on problems and code that we’ve never seen before.  But the challenge is definitely worth while.  It’s a great tool for teaching good coding practices and how to work with a team.  By the end of the three weeks, the students have a lot more confidence that they can contribute to a production code base.

13,Debugging Like a Scientist,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/debugging-like-a-scientist,"
When you're first learning how to code, error messages can be intimidating. Because of this, beginners sometimes ignore error messages entirely. Instead, they will favor more of a ""guess-and-check"" approach to fixing bugs. While we don't encourage this approach at Rithm, we recognize that in the context of solving small, isolated problems, it can be successful. But when it comes to working on larger applications, professional engineers need a more sophisticated set of tools to fix problems.
Fortunately, one of the most successful strategies for fixing errors is also one of the oldest: applying the scientific method. In this post, I'd like to review the scientific method, and highlight how you can use it to solve programming problems more quickly.

14,The Benefits of Code Reviews,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/benefits-of-code-reviews,"
Code reviews can be a common practice for many developers: another engineer, often more experienced with the language, library, or code base being used, meets with the author-developer to read through their work, ask questions, and provide suggestions for improvement.
This process can be a positive experiment for many, but often, it can be challenging to be on the receiving end of a review. These can descend into demands for  needless uniformity of style (""no! it's super-important to align your code just so"") or they can create uncomfortable or harmful power dynamics between peers about whose style or ideas are ""better."" At their very worst, code reviews can merely provide cover for biased viewpoints or microaggressions directed toward developers who may have less power in organizations.
While we recognize that not all parts of this practice are always helpful, we do encourage a lot of code reviews for our students here at Rithm. We think that, especially for newer developers in a class, these can provide useful feedback and lessons that can be difficult to get from lectures or books, and can also be hard to notice just from reading other code.

15,Three More JavaScript Mistakes That Beginners Make,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/three-more-js-mistakes-that-beginners-make,"
Despite its best intentions, JavaScript is not the most beginner friendly language. After working with thousands of beginners, here are a few common mistakes we see with applicants and students.
A little while back, we wrote a post on the top four javascript mistakes beginners make. In this post, we'll be adding a few more we've seen to help you better prepare when learning the basics!
Let’s imagine we have the following object,
When accessing a key in an object, there are two possible ways to go about it.
dot notation
bracket notation
Knowing when to use which one is essential, so here is a good rule of thumb to follow.If you know with 100% certainty what the key is - always use dot. If you are not 100% sure what the key will be, you must use bracket.

Before Kristen discovered programming, she was an elementary school teacher, and then a stay at home parent. When she’s AFK, she loves reading (If something has to do with magic or outer space, she’s probably read it or wants to read it), puzzles, games and travel. Her idea of a great party involves tabletop games, wine, and puns so cringe worthy that even your dad would groan. Kristen was able to take some time from her busy schedule to share more about her experience as a student, offer her advice for new students, and explain how the skills she learned at Rithm School will be used in her new position as a Software Engineer at Maven Technologies.

21,A New Tuition Option: We Make Money Only When You Do,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/new-tuition-option,"
When we first started Rithm in 2016, we made a bet. We believed that there would be people willing to pay a bit more for an immersive coding program that placed the quality of the education and student experience first.
Two years later, we’ve proven that you can build a successful program that focuses on small class sizes and experienced instructors. Our graduates have gone on to work at top-tier companies like Pinterest and Palantir. 74% of our graduates find work within 90 days, and with a median salary of $110,000 (details here).
But there are still challenges. To date, our biggest difficulty has been making the program as affordable as possible without sacrificing quality. Our pricing has always been $24,000, which unfortunately has made our program inaccessible to many potential students. That’s why we’re excited to announce that starting with our first class next year, we’ll be adding a deferred tuition option. This means that you won’t have to pay any tuition until you find a job as an engineer.

22,MongoDB is Easy,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/mongodb-is-easy,"
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database provider. Here at Rithm School we used to teach MongoDB in conjunction with Node.js. Recently, however, we have switched our Node.js curriculum to utilize PostgreSQL. For a taste of what that looks like, check out Joel's blog post or our free online curriculum on relational databases with Node/Express.
Much of the reason for this curriculum change is that relational databases, the SQL language, and ORMs can take a long time to master and are more widely-used across the industry. We decided therefore it would be best if our students could focus on mastering SQL and relational databases (the dominant database tech for the last 40 years) rather than split that time between a completely different technology that has only recently risen in popularity.
But another significant reason that I would like to argue is: MongoDB really isn't that hard to learn and master! If you're comfortable with JavaScript, JSON, and Node.js/Express.js (which all of our graduates are), then teaching yourself MongoDB can be a cakewalk. Especially if you have this blog post! 😉

24,Error Handling in Express,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/error-handling-express,"
Express is a flexible framework for building server-side JavaScript web servers using Node. We teach it here at Rithm School, and students often enjoy getting a chance to use their JavaScript skills on both the front-end and back-end, using Express to build API servers.
One area that can be confusing for new users is how to handle errors well using Express. Express is so flexible that it's not clear how to make a simple, general purpose strategy for handling different kinds of errors.
To help with this, here is a simple, new-learner-friendly system for making and handling errors in Express.

26,Five Tips to Manage the Emotional Side of a Coding Program,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/five-tips-emotional-management,"
A lot of people who decide to come like a program like Rithm's spend a lot of time trying to prepare as much as possible for the technical curriculum. We'll often get e-mails from accepted students before the program starts asking what else they can learn or study so that they'll be ahead of the curve when the program begins.
While that sort of planning and dedication is admirable, there's another aspect to immersive coding programs like ours that gets comparatively less attention, though it's no less important. I'm referring to the emotional weight of a full-time, in-person accelerated program. In this post, I'd like to outline some of the emotional challenges that students face, and provide some tips to help you address those challenges head on.

27,Does Emotional Intelligence Get You Paid More in Tech?,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/emotional-intelligence,"
Until recently, many people thought the sole source of success boiled down to their intelligence (IQ). However, research has been emerging since the late 90’s that there is a definitive link between career success and emotional intelligence (EQ). Intelligence is your ability to learn, which remains the same whether you’re 15 or 50 years old. EQ is not a steadfast metric, it’s a flexible set of skills that can be learned and improved with practice. You may be saying to yourself “but my technical skills will speak for themselves - why should I care about this?”

30,Different Approaches to Using Relational Databases with Express,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/different-approaches-express,"
JavaScript is increasingly popular for developing backend servers, often using the Express library with Node. While many tutorials show using Node/Express with NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, these kind of databases are often not as good for common, relational data requirements. Many projects would benefit from a more scalable, transactional relational database.
However, this leads to developer design decisions: should I write SQL queries directly in my code? Should I use an abstraction layer? Should I use an Object-Relational Mapper?
In this post, we'll explore a few approaches to the same problem. We'll use a tiny application, but develop it for each approach, so you can get an early sense of how it would be to work in these different styles.

31,The Job Funnel,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/the-job-funnel,"
No matter where you are in your career, looking for a new job is an incredibly stressful time. It's common to experience feelings of inadequacy, rejection, and general imposter syndrome.
This is a natural consequence of company hiring practices, which typically are engineered to minimize the rate of false positives (e.g. hiring someone unqualified for the job). Knowing this doesn't always ease the pain of not landing that dream job, though.
Even so, it can be helpful to try to zoom out and take a high level, objective look at the job search process. That's what I'd like to do here. My hope that by exploring a model of the job search, you'll be able to more effectively budget your time and more quickly find success.

This week is an exciting time in the life of our cohort and Rithm School as a whole. Our students are wrapping up their assigned work as developers for our company partnerships and transitioning into the next stage of the process: the outcomes, job-search portion. For the first time, Rithm School will be doing this work in-house and officially taking over the full cohort experience.
We’ve gradually built toward this path over the past six months by listening to prior experiences of Rithm alumni, taking into account industry-wide recruiting experiences and approaches, and also advising previous cohorts as they pursue new roles, interview processes, negotiations, and offers. Each of these conversations and experiences has provided us with a greater sense of how we can best equip our students to excel in their job search.

41,The Benefit of Low-Abstraction Frameworks for Scaffolding Learning,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/low-abstraction-frameworks,"
Here at Rithm, we teach both Javascript and Python. Most of our course is taught in Javascript, but two weeks focus on Python, particularly focusing on building web application servers for the backend.
During the period, we teach Flask, a Python framework for building web applications. Out of the box, Flask includes features such as:
Flask is a popular library for this kind of development, but it's not the dominant or most featured library in this space. Django is used widely in industry, and has far more features out of the box (including things like deeply built-in support for connecting to databases, an ""Object Relational Mapper"" for querying and updating those databases, a system for handling user registration/login/authentication, and more).
Given that Django is also very popular and even more featureful, why do we teach Flask at Rithm School?

42,Are Coding Schools Worth the Cost?,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/are-coding-schools-worth-the-cost,"
We talk to a lot of potential students here at Rithm. Many of them are incredibly passionate about learning how to code, and value Rithm's unique program, including our focus on small class sizes and exposure to real-world projects.
Even so, there's a fair amount of competition in our space, and potential students are right to shop around before finding the right fit. And while a lot of the value we think we add is hard to quantify, for some students the choice of which school to attend really boils down to a numbers game. For those people, I've cooked up a little tool to help you make a decision about which school to attend (or whether you should attend one at all). Let's take a look!

46,The Art of Outreach,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/the-art-of-outreach,"
Recently, we've decided to grow the services we offer to students. One of the most significant changes involves our transition to bring the outcomes component of the curriculum in-house. More on that here if you’re interested.
With this transition comes a great sense of excitement, namely with our ability to take ownership around the entirety of the student experience. We’re actively shaping the outcomes portion to have even more continuity with the technical instruction and ultimately prepare our students earlier, throughout Rithm’s first ten weeks, to more seamlessly transition into their company projects and job search. That said, another component of the process that we find exciting is in crafting curriculum. And this week’s blog post is aimed at highlighting a section of that curriculum: outreach.

47,Intro to VS Code,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/vscode,"
The most important tool for developers is that which lets us author code: the development environment. At Rithm School, we think it’s essential for all of our students to be on the same page as our instructors in using the same development environment. Thus, we are going to recommend using Visual Studio Code for our current and future students. Here’s why.

48,Debugging Like a Developer,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/debugging-like-a-developer,"
When you're working closely with students every day, you get really good at debugging. I pretty much see bugs all day everyday. Some are standard issues that I came across when I was learning the material myself, while others are really strange edge cases I may never have discovered on my own.
Helping students squash bugs is great, but what's even better is teaching them the skills they need to squash bugs on their own. In this post, I'd like to highlight a few of the techniques you can use to more effectively debug your code, and how to ask the right questions to help you track down the source of your problem.

At Rithm, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare students for jobs as web developers is by giving them opportunities to work on real-world projects. Working on personal projects can be fun, but working in a team or on an existing code base gives students insights into the day-to-day challenges of a developer that they might not otherwise learn. Our 5th cohort is nearing the end of working on these projects, so we spoke with our students Allie Antkowiak and Stephen Carrera to get their perspective on the experience.

In this blog post series, we will build a concrete roadmap to help you get started understanding the basics of programming. More importantly, we’ll help you figure out if coding is something you really want to do!
Like many of our blog posts, this is just one opinion and one way of going about things. We believe it’s most rewarding to be able to build things that you can see in the browser and easily share with others, so the first place to start with that is by learning some HTML and CSS. You’d be surprised how much you can get done with just a little bit of markup and styling on the page!

55,Five Tips for Landing a Job as a Bootcamp Grad,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/five-tips-for-landing-a-job,"
During my tenure as a tech lead at Emsi, I had the opportunity to screen and interview a few dozen candidates for junior front-end engineering positions, and I looked at quite a few bootcamp grad applications. I want to be candid up front: I had a slight bias towards people with computer science degrees from universities (I also had one myself) over bootcamp graduates. The CS degree indicated they had spent several years thinking about challenging technical problems and could probably pick up frontend skills quickly -- even though the bootcamp grads, in theory, would be better-prepared for immediate frontend / web development type work. I was also concerned that bootcamp grads might be able to make web apps look pretty, but when it came to whiteboarding out a new algorithm (seldom as that might happen on the job), they might be all but useless compared to a CS major.

56,"Our Newest Scholarship, Diversity, and How Rithm Supports Your Coding Education",https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/our-newest-scholarship,"
We have seen the value in providing scholarships to highly motivated web development students over the course of our tenure. The first official scholarship we offered was in late 2016, where we awarded 50% of tuition costs to mission-driven individuals with a positive impact on their community. Since then we have offered many partial scholarships based on merit and need, and one full Diversity Scholarship.
On the tails of our first scholarship, we wanted to honor future women developers alongside Women’s History Month. In March of 2017 we awarded partial scholarships to all women who were accepted to our third cohort. We were thrilled with the results of this scholarship initiative, as it resulted in a classroom comprised of 60% innovative and brilliant women.

No other coding school that we’re aware of has released so much of its curriculum online at absolutely no cost. We also recently released a course on Udemy that covers a lot of intermediate and advanced material for aspiring web developers.
At the same time, we continue to offer a full-time paid immersive program here in San Francisco. To some, these two activities -- offering free curriculum online along with paid courses in-person -- can seem incompatible. Why charge for classes when so much of the content being taught is free?

Focus on quality, not quantity
When I first decided I wanted to learn how to code, I tried to tackle all languages and technologies at once.  I knew that I needed to learn JavaScript, but I was also fascinated by mobile and backend development. I spent hours learning PHP and JavaScript, watching Objective C tutorials, and building small web and mobile applications.

There's been a lot of buzz lately about the recent high-profile closing of two coding schools: Dev Bootcamp and The Iron Yard. Depending on where you get your news, the back-to-back shuttering of these schools is either an anomaly in an otherwise healthy industry, or it's the first indication that the industry Dev Bootcamp pioneered is now ending.
Neither of these extremes totally captures the reality; the truth is more complicated. While I was certainly surprised to hear about these schools winding down, the challenges they described in their public statements definitely resonated.
In this post, I'd like to dig into one of the biggest challenges I've seen discussed. It's tied to one of Silicon Valley's favorite buzzwords, but is also frequently at odds with high-quality education. That word is scale.

It can be tempting to think that your work is done after you've solved a problem, especially if the problem has been a difficult one. But as Polya writes in How To Solve It, reflection is an important part of effective problem solving:
Even fairly good students, when they have obtained the solution of the problem and written down neatly the argument, shut their books and look for something else. Doing so, they miss an important and instructive phase of the work. By looking back at the completed solution, by reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path that led to it, they could consolidate their knowledge and develop their ability to solve problems...There always remains something to do; with sufficient study and penetration, we could improve any solution, and, in any case, we can always improve our understanding of the solution.
In this final post, we'll take a look at this final strategy from the standpoint of programming.

I have to be honest.  In the past, I did not like going to conferences.  I found them boring and not too productive.  The main reason for all this dislike was the type of conference I used to go to.  I started out my career in the academic world. I was in a computer science PhD program at Georgia Tech, and I can safely say that I did not find the conferences that I attended to be very helpful.  I ""dropped out"" of grad school with a masters and then became a software engineer at Amazon. Amazon did not have a culture of sending developers to conferences, so again, I avoided them.

In How To Solve It, mathematician George Polya breaks the problem-solving process down into four pieces: understanding the problem, making a plan, executing the plan, and reflecting on the solution. We've already talked about understanding the problem, but the next parts of this process could benefit from a little unpacking.
Whether you're building a new feature for an application with millions of users, or in the middle of a whiteboard interview, it's essential that you have a plan before you start coding. But planning often requires forethought and insight that comes from experience. Because of this, beginners often feel trapped in a sort of catch-22: they need experience in order to formulate plans effectively, but they need to plan effectively in order to solve problems and gain experience!

One of the biggest challenges for the aspiring web developer has little to do with the details of programming. As an engineer, you'll be tasked with understanding and solving problems on a regular basis; regardless of the specific technologies you use, then, strong problem-solving ability is critical.
And while your problem-solving skills will certainly develop naturally as you write code, it's worth being a bit more intentional, and think about problem-solving strategies in general. In this series, we'll take a look at some common problem-solving strategies, and adapt them to the life of a web developer.

93,Essential Tools for Web Development,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/essential-tools-for-web-development,"
[Updated July 11, 2018]
Every developer's workflow is slightly different. And because people can have such strong opinions about the best text editor, web browser, and tooling, finding the workflow that works for you isn't always easy.
However, once you've found the tools that are right for you, and know how to use those tools successfully, the rate at which you can program can increase tremendously. And after working with a number of students, we've got our own opinions about tools a beginning developer should absolutely have. In this post, we'd like to offer up the technologies that we think are the most helpful, as well as instructions on how to install those tools (or access them, in the even that they're already installed). Please note: the installation process assumes that you are using a Mac with OSX.

94,Five Reasons to Learn JavaScript,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/five-reasons-to-learn-javascript,"
Over the past few years, JavaScript has exploded in popularity. According to StackOverflow's 2016 developer survey, JavaScript is the most popular technology for full-stack, front-end, and back-end developers, and isn't showing any signs of losing momentum. So how did we get here, and what does it mean for someone who wants to learn to code? In this article, we'll trace back some of the history, project a little bit into the future, and offer up some reasons why, if you're interested in programming, you should give JavaScript a shot.

95,Free Course Prep,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/free-course-prep,"
We've been talking to a number of potential students over the past few weeks, and have had some great conversations with students from a variety of backgrounds. As we've been having these conversations, though, a challenge has emerged. With so many resources available for people who want to learn on their own, and with the emergence of short courses like First Step Coding aimed at people who are on the fence about a career change into web development, people are coming to us from different backgrounds and with varying levels of experience. So how can we try to level that playing field, and assess who would be a good fit for our program as objectively as possible?

96,Building Better Job Support,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/building-better-job-support,"
One of the nice things about working at a coding school compared to a more traditional educational environment is that we don't need to grapple with some of the headier philosophical questions surrounding the purpose of education. For us, the purpose is clear: get students job-ready in 16 weeks.
With that clarity of purpose also comes a straightforward metric to measure our own success: are students getting jobs? If students leave our program and can find and retain jobs as developers, that's a pretty clear signal that we're on the right track.

97,Why Another Bootcamp?,https://www.rithmschool.com/blog/blog/why-another-bootcamp,"
Hi! Welcome to the Rithm blog. We're a team of passionate educators and developers who have decided to open a web development school in San Francisco.
To the casual observer, this may seem like a strange choice. After all, there are already plenty of options for the aspiring web developer. Do some quick research and you'll find all kinds of programs: 12-week programs, 24-week programs, 36-week programs, and more; full-time programs and part-time programs; online programs and in-person programs. The list goes on, and is particularly long in the Bay Area. So why throw our collective hats in the ring?
